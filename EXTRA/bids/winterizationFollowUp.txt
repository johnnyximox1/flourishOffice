Hello jacob,
I appreciate your work, but we received a rejection/denial from the client that the winterization is not completed cause you missed to pour antifreez.Client won't accept the W.O without pouring antifreez on property.

Please, can you visit the property and pour antifreez where needed so that we can complete this job and close the work order buddy.

Thanks,
Johnny
